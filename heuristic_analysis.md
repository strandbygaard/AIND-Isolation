* custom_score(): implement your own best position evaluation heuristic
* custom_score_2(): implement your own alternate position evaluation heuristic
* custom_score_3(): implement your own alternate position evaluation heuristic

# Requirements
For each of your three custom heuristic functions, evaluate the performance of the heuristic using the included tournament.py script. Then write up a brief summary of your results, describing the performance of the agent using the different heuristic functions verbally and using appropriate visualizations.

Your analysis should conclude with a comparison of the different heuristics and your reasoning for choosing the heuristic you ultimately use in your submitted agent.
